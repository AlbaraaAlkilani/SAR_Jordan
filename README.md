# SAR_Jordan
## Project Description

**SAR in Jordan** is an open-source effort to assemble and share the data and tools needed for Search & Rescue (SAR) research in Jordanâ€™s varied environments. This repository brings together:
- **Annotated imagery** (hosted on Roboflow) with bounding-box labels for human targets and key environmental features.  
- **Processing scripts & notebooks** to clean, augment, and merge these multimodal data streams into ready-to-train datasets.  
- **Training examples** demonstrating how to load the data, build a simple detection model, and evaluate performance on held-out test splits.
- **Drone Routing Algorith** scripts that generate search patterns for UAVs based on terrain maps, sensor inputs, and mission constraints.

Our goal is to lower the barrier for researchers and developers to experiment with UAV-based SAR algorithms in desert, urban, and rural settings. All data and code in this repo are licensed under **CC BY-NC 4.0** for non-commercial research and educational use.
